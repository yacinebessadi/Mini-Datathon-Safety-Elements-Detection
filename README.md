# Mini-Datathon-Safety-Elements-Detection
This project was developed as part of a mini-datathon challenge. The goal was to detect safety-related objects in images (e.g., helmets, vests, gloves) using a pretrained convolutional neural network (resnet50).
🛠️ What I Did
Collected and explored image dataset (classification task)

Fine-tuned a ResNet50 model using PyTorch

Applied data transformations and augmentation

Built a simple web app with Flask to upload and classify images

📉 Limitations
Accuracy still needs improvement

The model struggles to correctly detect specific elements (e.g., red hats)

Further training, hyperparameter tuning, and data cleaning required

📚 What I Learned
Transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques

Building a basic web interface for model testing

Handling real-world image datasets

Challenges in model generalization and dataset imbalance
